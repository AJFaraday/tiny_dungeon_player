The Tiny Dungeon Player is a project by Andrew Faraday
(@MarmiteJunction) who built the website, interactions,
game dynamics and who hosts the server.

The live server is a Raspberry Pi under Andrews bed.

The level design is generated algorithmically and distributed
by a Twitter bot, @TinyDungeons. Tiny Dungeons was created and
is maintained by Noah Swartz (@SwartzCr). He has been a sounding-board
throughout the project, supporting the development and balancing of the 
Player throughout it's life-span.

## Lovely People

While Tiny Dungeon Player is very much the baby of Andrew
Faraday, it would not be the project it is today without
the help of some lovely people who've tried it out, logged
bugs and generally provided feedback during its difficult
youth.

These people have earned my thanks and something of each of
them remains in this project.
