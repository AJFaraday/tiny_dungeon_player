# Tiny Dungeon Player
## By Andrew Faraday (@MarmiteJunction)

Caution: VERY EARLY BETA

### Background

Tiny Dungeons (@TinyDungeons) is a bot and Twitter account by
Noah Swartz (@SwartzCr). It generates RPG style dungeon maps
using emoji for the tiles.

Andrew was inspired by this map generator and decided to write
a companion application which makes the emoji dungeons playable.

It's small, it's simple, and it's still basically a proof of concept.

Can you help? Coding (JavaScript)? testing? sound effects?
issue logging? I'd love to hear from you.

### Installation

* Clone the repo (https://github.com/AJFaraday/tiny_dungeon_player)
* Open /public/index.html in FireFox

### Emoji Support

For now, Tiny Dungeon Player relies on emoji fonts.

My testing in Linux suggests that this will display
best in FireFox.

If you see a wide selection of empty squares, then
you may have to install an emoji font.

There are plans to fix this issue, in the fullness of time.
